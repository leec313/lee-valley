            <h2>A little bit about us</h2>
            <p>Just twenty minutes from Dublin airport, set on 400 acres of lush private parkland placed perfectly in the Lee Valley, lies a championship golf course befitting a country in the top tier of global golfing destinations. The 18-hole championship Golf Course at Lee Valley is naturally-contoured with mature parklands, bunkers, water hazards and a state-of-the-art, clubhouse.
                The only thing to rival the quality of golf on offer, is the spectacular setting. From the famous River Liffey flowing past, to the majesty of the Irish castle hiding amongst the trees, it’s a challenge to concentrate on your game when you’re surrounded by such incredible scenery.
                At the end of eighteen holes, a state-of-the-art, clubhouse awaits you, your playing partners and your stories of success.
